# Module: Dispatcher.py
# Purpose: to ease the process of working with subprocesses, as long as those
#	subprocesses do not require input via stdin
# Author: jsb

# Examples:  Say you have a script, foo, that takes a range of keys (start and
#	stop) as parameters and does some reporting for a particular type of
#	database object with that range of keys.  We know that there are many
#	of these keys, so we decide to work in parallel to speed things up.
#
#	Let's use ranges of 10,000 values for these keys, and the default
#	set of 5 simultaneous processes, as in:
#		ranges = [ (0, 10000), (10001, 20000), ... (490000, 500000) ]
#		dispatcher = Dispatcher ()
#		ids = []
#		for (start, stop) in ranges:
#			cmd = 'foo %d %d' % (start, stop)
#			ids.append (dispatcher.schedule (cmd))
#		dispatcher.wait()
#
#	Then, if you need to echo to stdout whatever the subprocesses had
#	written to their stdouts, you could do:
#		for id in ids:
#			sys.stdout.write (''.join(dispatcher.getStdout(id)))
#
#	If we didn't care about accessing the output from the subprocesses,
#	then we wouldn't need to commands' IDs and the call could be as
#	simple as:
#		cmds = map(lambda x : 'foo %d %d' % x, ranges)
#		Dispatcher(initialCommands = cmds).wait()
#
#	If we wanted to parallelize more and use 15 subprocesses, the last
#	line could be:
#		Dispatcher(15, cmds).wait()
#
# Note: If one of your subprocesses produces a lot of output, you will want to
#	specify the optional bufsize parameter when instantiating your
#	Dispatcher, with some large value of bytes.  For most cases, the
#	default of None will work, but if you experience a seemingly hung
#	subprocess, it may be that it's waiting to write a larger amount than
#	the buffer size allows.

	#	on the number of concurrent subprocesses to allow

	# Notes: This class does not run asynchronously within the Python

	#	and to start up new ones for all instantiated Dispatchers.
